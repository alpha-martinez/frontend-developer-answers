## What did you learn yesterday/this week?

I learned about binary trees and how to keep them balanced. Basically, a tree is made of a collection of nodes and edges. Each node have three properties, except for the root node, which are value, left property, and right property. Value represents the data. Left property represents a value less than the current node value and right property is a node greater than the current node value. Another important thing I learned was that a node can have at most two branches and it's important to have a balanced out binary tree than an unbalanced one. There are several ways to get a binary tree balanced again by using left-left imbalance, right-right imbalance, left-right balance, and right-left imbalance. 

## What excites or interests you about coding? 

Coding has challeneged me, in a positive way, by being able to create new functionalities and being able to handle problems and fix it. There are also new updates being made to current languages for you to learn and implement, so its a never ending knowledge builder. There is always so much more to learn and different ways of doing one simple function which amazes me everyday. 

## What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?

For my third project, my group and I had built an app, called ApartMate, using React, and Mongo DB, we created an app where it involved being able to get a user to create a group and being able to add their roommates in that same group the owner had created. I was working on the group component with my teammate and we were struggling trying to get the groupId and group name to show up in the group component. My teammate and I were looking for different ways to get it to show up on the page when I remembered that we could have used useState([]) and called the setState in the axios call for it to notice the change its being made and call out the non setState in the useEffect. The change would happen when the user clicked on the button. 

## When building a new web site or maintaining one, can you explain some techniques you have used to increase performance?

For the ApartMate app, I posted it on my Linkedin to spread awareness to my fellow peers and gave the link to my friends, so they can see what we had created and give us advice on what else to include or fix. My teammates also did the same and even went ahead and shared it to our fellow classmates in other cohorts to check it out. 

## Can you describe some SEO best practices or techniques you have used lately?

In my linkedin posts, I used keywords such as Javascript, HTML, CSS to make my posts stand out and get more attention from other people who are interested in seeing what I had to show or give me any few pointers if needed.
